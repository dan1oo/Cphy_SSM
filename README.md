# Cphy_SSM

### Description

This project is based on Albert Gu's paper 'Efficiently Modeling Long Sequences with Structred State Spaces': `https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00396`. We aim to implement a single head of this model, and apply it to a simple long sequence prediction challenge and evaulate and visualize it's performance.

### Directory Structure

`demos.ipynb` - Script for Model implementation demo on arbitrary simulation
`.\SSM` - Containerized State Space Model (in one class ideally)
`.\Simulations`- Simulation Scripts 
`.\Helpers` - Helper functions for data + metric testing 
`.\Data` - Data

### Plan of Implementation

Week 1. Implement Model V1 Basic SSM, Preprocess Data/setup rough simulation
Week 2. Training + Test Model on simulation and debug/optimize, Start visualization
Week 3. Metric analysis + presentation creation
